              &quot;Neera: The Guest House&quot; was born from a desire to
              create a space that feels like home for travelers seeking both
              comfort and a deeper connection with Ujjain&apos;s spiritual
              essence. We chose the term &quot;Guest House&quot; to emphasize
              our commitment to providing a warm, welcoming environment, much
              like the traditional Indian concept of &apos;Atithi Devo
              Bhava&apos; (Guest is God).

            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 hidden md:block">
              A guest house offers a more personal touch, where every visitor is
              treated as a cherished guest in our home. Our name,
              &quot;Neera,&quot; inspired by the purity of water, reflects the
              calm and refreshing experience we strive to offer each guest.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed hidden md:block">
              Our aim is to create a sanctuary where you feel more like a guest
              in a loved one&apos;s home, surrounded by care and tranquility.
              Our goal is to make you feel like a special guest in a loved one's
              home, with plenty of care and peace.
